SimpleLance
===========

A simple customer management / invoicing / project tracking tool built for freelancers.

Install by copying files to web root and importing sql file. Make sure to edit config.php to suit

Note that projects can only be added by admin at present, this may change if demand calls for it.

There is also currently no support for alerts for tickets, projects or invoices and also invoices are not automatically
updated when past due.  This is all to come in future release.

2 Accounts exist, 1 admin and 1 customer.

admin - email = admin@simplelance.com / password = admin123 <br>
customer - email = customer@simplelance.com / password = customer123

Development is ongoing and updates will be released as regular as possible.
